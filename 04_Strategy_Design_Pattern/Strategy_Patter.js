/** STRATEGY DESIGN PATTERN */
//The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms,
// put each one in a separate class (or function), and make them interchangeable at runtime.
// It enables selecting an algorithmâ€™s behavior at runtime without altering the code that uses it.
// Component	          Role
// Context	            Uses a Strategy to perform an action (eg: NetflixSubscription)
// Strategy             Interface	Defines a method that each strategy must implement (eg: planInfo method of each strategy)
// Concrete Strategy	  Specific implementations of the algorithm(eg: SingleUserSubStrategy)
